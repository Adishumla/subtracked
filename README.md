## A subscription tracking app powered by supabase and React Native through Expo Go as well as a throng of imports.

### By Adam Garali & [Ruben Olander](https://github.com/rubenolander)

## Project description

**Abonna** was created with the aim of simplifying the process of managing and tracking the subscriptions of the everyday person, helping them gain a clear overview of monthly expenses. Albeit a school assignment, the project has been created with caring design from the digital design students Linn√©a and Amanda and then thoughtfully realized by us. The entire thing is in Swedish right now.

## What it does:

- Let's the user add subscriptions to their account with the following information.
  - Service name
  - Service cost per month
  - Logo
  - Subscription type (Own, shared, family)
  - Subscription category (a selection of seven right now)
  - Payment date (date picker)
- View subscriptions on either the overview page where the user can sort by type or on the payments page where it's shown by month.
- User settings
  - Change account name,
  - reset password
  - Switch darkmode on/off
  - Switch push notifications on/off
  - Log out user.

## Tech

Written in React Native using Typescript in the developer environment Expo Go, the project also utilises zod for filling in forms correctly and is styled using tailwindcss.
